# Chatter - Chatroom with various rooms and users.

This was my first time using Socket.io to test it out. Made a little chatroom app where you can choose rooms and username for yourself. With Socket.Io there will be a message for all users
to tell if a new user has connected or disconnected. Everyone in the same room will see it. 

Also you can see user list on the side and see all the users who are online. 

#Simple chatroom app with Socket.io, HTML, JavaScript and a little tiny bit of CSS.
What I learned: How to use Socket.io, how to emit and broadcast messages.  I also used a bit of express for server but didn't add database to it. Might do some work in the future.
